# Chatbot Using NLP

This is a chatbot project that uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to generate responses to user input. The chatbot is implemented using Python and various libraries such as NLTK, spaCy, and scikit-learn.

## Installation

To run the chatbot, you'll need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can install it by following the instructions on the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once you have Python installed, you'll need to install the required libraries. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the necessary libraries, including NLTK, spaCy, and scikit-learn.

## Usage

To run the chatbot, simply run the `chatgui.py` file:

```
python chatgui.py
```

This will start the chatbot in gui . You can then type in a message and the chatbot will respond with a generated message.

## Customization

You can customize the chatbot's behavior by modifying json file (intents.json) and retrain the model -> code in `train_chatbot.py`. For example, you can add new rules for generating responses, or you can modify the preprocessing steps to better handle user input.

## Credits

This project was inspired by the book "Practical Natural Language Processing" by Kanhaiya Nayak (202262004) (contact me if you want a copy of that book ðŸ˜‚ )
